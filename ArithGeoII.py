#     Description: For this challenge you will determine if numbers within an array follow an arithmetic or geometric sequence.
#     Arith Geo II

#     Have the function ArithGeoII(arr) take the array of numbers stored in arr
#     and return the string "Arithmetic" if the sequence follows an arithmetic pattern
#     or return "Geometric" if it follows a geometric pattern. If the sequence doesn't follow either pattern return -1.
#     An arithmetic sequence is one where the difference between each of the numbers is consistent,
#     where as in a geometric sequence, each term after the first is multiplied by some constant or common ratio.

#     Arithmetic example: [2, 4, 6, 8] and Geometric example: [2, 6, 18, 54].
#     Negative numbers may be entered as parameters, 0 will not be entered, and no array will contain all the same elements.

#     Examples
#     Input: {5,10,15}
#     Output: Arithmetic

#     Input: {2,4,16,24}
#     Output: -1

#     Description: For this challenge you will determine which word has the greatest number of repeated letters.

#     Have the function LetterCount(str) take the str parameter being passed and return the
#     first word with the greatest number of repeated letters.

#     For example: "Today, is the greatest day ever!" should return greatest because it has 2 e's (and 2 t's)
#     and it comes before ever which also has 2 e's. If there are no words with repeating letters return -1.

#     Words will be separated by spaces.

#     Examples
#     Input: "Hello apple pie"
#     Output: Hello

#     Input: "No words"
#     Output: -1
